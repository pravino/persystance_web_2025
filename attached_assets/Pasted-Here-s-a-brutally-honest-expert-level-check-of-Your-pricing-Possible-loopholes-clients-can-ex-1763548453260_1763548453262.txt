Here’s a brutally honest, expert-level check of:

✅ Your pricing
✅ Possible loopholes clients can exploit
✅ Competitiveness for Sri Lanka + global Tier 2

I’ll be very direct so you can fix things BEFORE clients take advantage of you.

✅ 1. PRICING VALIDATION (Is your pricing OK?)
✔ Your pricing is NOT Sri Lanka pricing (which is good)

If you price for Sri Lanka, clients will expect:

Appointment systems = $500–$1,500

Taxi apps = $1,500–$3,000

Exchange = $3,000–$6,000 (fake exchanges, low quality)

But you’re not competing with local devs.
You're competing with:

UAE

Singapore

India

Malaysia

Indonesia

Vietnam

Your pricing fits global buyers, NOT Sri Lankan buyers.

✔ Your prices are EXACTLY in the correct ready-made SaaS bracket
Product	Your MVP Price	Fair Market Price	Status
Appointment System	$6k	$5k–$12k	Perfect
KYC Module	$5k	$4k–$10k	Perfect
Taxi App	$8k	$10k–$25k	Slightly underpriced
Property Mgmt	$12k	$12k–$25k	Perfect
Commodity Exchange	$20k	$20k–$40k	Spot on
Crypto Exchange	$25k	$25k–$60k	Slightly underpriced

👉 Your pricing is competitive. You are NOT overpriced.
In fact, two products are slightly under-priced (Taxi App, Exchange), but this may help sales volume.

✅ 2. LOOPHOLE ANALYSIS (BIG PROBLEMS MOST FOUNDERS MISS)

I’ll list ALL the dangerous client loopholes I see in your current model.

❗ Loophole #1 – “MVP” definition is vague

Clients will say:

“But I thought MVP includes this also…”

If your MVP scope is not bulletproof documented, they will abuse it.

Fix: Create a 1-page PDF for each product:

MVP: Exactly what is included

Full: Exactly what extra features are included

Delivery timeline

Change-request pricing

I can create these PDFs if you want.

❗ Loophole #2 – “Customisation Included?”

Clients will push:

“Change the UI like this”

“Add one more API”

“Support Arabic too”

If you don’t define:

What level of UI changes are free

If language localization is free

If API additions are free

If white-labelling is free or paid

…clients will drag you into 30–60 days of work for free.

Fix:
Include a line:

“MVP includes 5–10 minor customizations. Anything beyond is separately quoted.”

❗ Loophole #3 – Deployment and Infrastructure

Clients will ask:

“Can you deploy it on my own server?”

“Can you reduce server cost?”

“Can you optimize it?”

“Can you handle cloud setup?”

If not priced, they expect it free.

Fix:
Deployment should be charged separately:

$300 basic deploy (Docker / VPS)

$1,000 advanced deploy (AWS / GCP / cluster)

Add this in your pricing.

❗ Loophole #4 – Support & SLA

If you don’t define support windows, they will message you at:

2 AM

Weekends

Public holidays

And expect immediate answers.

Fix: Support tiers:

Tier	SLA	Price
Basic	72 hours	Free
Standard	24 hours	$200–$300/mo
Premium	4 hours	$500–$800/mo

And forced renewal yearly.

❗ Loophole #5 – “Lifetime license? Or yearly renewal?”

Clients will assume:

One-time payment = lifetime ownership

You must define:

One-time license
OR

Yearly renewal

Best:

✔ One-time fee = app code
✔ Yearly fee = updates + bug fixes + hosting support

❗ Loophole #6 – Reuse of your IP

Clients may try to resell your product without paying you.

Fix: Add in contract:

“Client may NOT resell the software without written permission.”

Otherwise some Indian, UAE or Pakistani client will resell your entire app as their own product.

❗ Loophole #7 – Unlimited Users? Unlimited Admins?

If you don’t cap:

Number of users

Number of admins

Number of branches

They will scale from 10 clients → 10,000 clients on the same price.

✅ 3. YOUR PRICING vs SRI LANKA MARKET

Local clients:
90% can’t afford you.

Good.
You don’t want them.
They will waste time and bargain forever.

Foreign clients:
Your pricing is exactly at ideal Tier:

Tier 1 (US/EU) → cheap for them

Tier 2 (Middle East/Singapore/Malaysia) → perfect

Tier 3 (India/Pakistan) → slightly high but still sellable

Your customers should be:

🇦🇪 UAE
🇶🇦 Qatar
🇸🇦 Saudi
🇸🇬 Singapore
🇲🇾 Malaysia
🇮🇩 Indonesia
🇨🇦 Canada
🇺🇸 USA
🇬🇧 UK

NOT Sri Lanka.

⭐ FINAL VERDICT
✔ Pricing is fair
✔ Competitive globally
✔ You are not undercharging overall
❗ But several business loopholes can cause you to lose money

Your pricing strategy is solid — you’re positioned between templates and true SaaS, the BEST place to be.

But you must fix the loopholes, or clients will squeeze:

free customization

free support

unlimited deployments

unlimited revisions

free scaling

free hosting optimization

free feature additions

I can help you:

📌 Create the official pricing sheet
📌 Write the PDF scope for each product
📌 Create support SLA
📌 Create license agreement
📌 Create contract clauses to block abuse
