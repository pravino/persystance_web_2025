❗ 2. LOOPHOLES YOU MUST FIX OR CLIENTS WILL ABUSE YOU

Here are ALL the things clients will try to exploit.

❗ Loophole #1 — “What is a bug? What is a feature?”

If you do NOT define this clearly:

Clients will enter $30,000 worth of features inside a $300/mo plan.

Fix:

✔ Bug = breakage of existing feature
✔ Feature = anything new OR change in behavior
✔ UI changes = feature
✔ API changes = feature

Add to your terms.

❗ Loophole #2 — Unlimited bugs per month

Clients may submit 50 bugs in one month because they want free improvements.

Fix:

“Maintenance covers up to 10 bug tickets per month.
Additional: $25/ticket or $50/hr.”

❗ Loophole #3 — Unlimited feature requests in Managed

Currently you say:

“Small feature requests (up to 5 hours/month)”

This is good, but you MUST define:

What counts as “small”

What happens if they exceed 5 hours

Fix:

“After 5 hours → $60/hr.”

❗ Loophole #4 — Dedicated plan 15 hours is dangerous

15 hours of real development is worth $900–$1,200 by itself.
PLUS support.
PLUS calls.
PLUS emergency support.

You MUST:

define how many tasks they can add

require unused hours DO NOT roll over

prevent them from bundling 3 months to get 45 hours of free work

Fix:

“Hours do not roll over.”
“Limit of 10 tickets/month.”

Otherwise they will cheat.

❗ Loophole #5 — Phone support without boundaries

Clients will call you anytime, including:

2am

weekends

public holidays

Fix:

“Phone support available 9AM–9PM.
After-hours emergency = $250/incident.”

❗ Loophole #6 — Emergency 24/7 support

If you don’t define what is an “emergency,” they will send:

“Change this button color urgent!!!”

You MUST define:

Emergency = app down, payments down, security breach.

Everything else = normal support.
