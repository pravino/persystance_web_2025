Got you. I’ll analyze your pricing & tier system from a client-exploitation POV — to find loopholes where a client can get more than they should, push boundaries, or manipulate your structure.

🔍 Loophole Analysis — What Clients Can Abuse

Below is a full breakdown of hidden weaknesses in your pricing structure.

⚠️ 1. “Baseline Features” Are Too Broad

Your baseline includes:

API

DB

Responsive UI

Dashboard 5–8 pages

A smart client can abuse this by demanding:

🚨 MORE pages inside the "5–8 functional pages"

Example:

They say: “Dashboard includes all 8 modules right? Add these small 3 pages in the dashboard.”

Those 3 "small pages" are actually big features.

Fix:
Define the dashboard clearly:
“5 functional screens only. Additional screens are priced as add-ons.”

⚠️ 2. No limit on the complexity of baseline CRUD

CRUD sounds simple… but a customer can ask:

Complex filtering

Advanced validation

Aggregated reporting

Joined data

Multi-level permissions

File uploads

These are NOT CRUD, but they will claim it’s part of "RESTful API + CRUD".

Fix:
Define CRUD clearly:
“Basic Create/Read/Update/Delete for ONE entity = 1 CRUD module. Complex logic is an add-on.”

⚠️ 3. “Database Design (3–5 tables)” — Extremely abusable

Clients can push:

Complex relationships

Dynamic data structures

Role-based permissions

Multi-tenant architecture

Scaling requirements

All hidden inside those 3–5 tables.

Fix:
Define each table’s complexity:
“Simple table with up to 10 fields. Complex tables = add-on.”

⚠️ 4. Add-on Pricing Is Flat — but Add-ons Have MASSIVE complexity differences

Example:

Live Chat Support ($1,800)
– Could be as simple as a message list
– OR a fully real-time chat with notifications + read receipts + admin control.

Same price — client wins.

⚠️ 5. Add-on Order Does Not Clarify Scope

You say:

Standard = Max 3 features

Full = Max 6 features

Enterprise = Max 10 features

But you have 8 add-ons total.

So if a client chooses Enterprise:

The “10 feature limit” suggests they can invent 2 more custom features

Claim: “Your table says 10 features — I added 2 small ones.”

Fix:
Specify:
“Enterprise includes all 8 add-ons. Extra custom features priced separately.”

⚠️ 6. Time Allocation Might Be Abused

Example:
Standard MVP → 2 weeks extra for 3 features.
That means:

0.66 weeks (4.5 days) per feature

A client can pick 3 extremely heavy features:

Analytics Dashboard

WebSockets real-time

Payment Integration

Each of these is a WEEK of effort minimum.

Your schedule doesn’t cover the reality.

⚠️ 7. No Hosting / DevOps Cost Mentioned

Clients often “forget”:

Deployment

SSL

CI/CD

Staging environments

DB backup systems

Load testing

They will assume it’s "included in the app price".

Fix:
Add a section:
“Hosting & infrastructure billed separately.”

⚠️ 8. No Scope Control on “Responsive UI”

Clients can force:

Mobile-level refinement

Tablet layouts

Dynamic resizing

UX improvements

Which is not a simple responsive fix.

Fix:
Define:
“Responsive up to XYZ breakpoints. Custom UI = add-on.”

⚠️ 9. No Boundaries on Revisions

Clients can kill your life with revision requests.

Fix:
Set:
“2 revision cycles included per module. Additional revisions charged hourly.”

⚠️ 10. No Warranty/Support Policy Defined

Clients may assume:

Lifetime support

Unlimited bug fixes

New features after delivery

Fix:
Add a post-launch clause:
“30 days bug-fix warranty. Support plans available separately.”

⚠️ 11. No Clarification on “Payment Integration”

Clients can demand:

Subscriptions

Webhooks

Refund workflows

Automated invoices

Multi-currency

3D secure

Recurring billing

All under “Stripe integration”.

Fix:
Define the exact payment flow included.

⚠️ 12. PDF Generation Can Be Exploited

PDF generation includes:

Complex layout

Graphs

Multi-page reports

Templates

Watermarks

Clients will request a report engine for $1,000.

⚠️ 13. You Don’t Charge for Project Management

Your overhead is high (2.5M LKR monthly)

PM takes:

Planning

Documentation

Client calls

Testing

Deployment

You’re basically giving PM time for free.

⚠️ 14. Enterprise Tier is WAY underpriced

For 10 features + baseline:

You only charge $20k–$30k.

A Western team charges $60k–$120k.

Even Indian agencies charge $25k–$45k.

Your overhead alone is $8,300/month.

A 2-month project for Enterprise:

Cost: $16,600

Profit: $3,400–$13,400

But that’s assuming:

no delays

no extra calls

no revisions

no unexpected complexity

This is risky.

🔧 Summary of Fixes Needed

You MUST fix:

Define exactly what each baseline feature includes (limit scope).

Break down each add-on with clear acceptance criteria.

Add page limits, table limits, API limits.

Define revision limits.

Add hosting/devops costs.

Clarify support/warranty.

Disable custom features in Enterprise unless charged extra.

Document complexity boundaries to prevent manipulation.
